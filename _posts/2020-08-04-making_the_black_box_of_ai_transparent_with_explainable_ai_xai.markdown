A quick overview of Shaply(SHAP) values


Artificial Intelligence(AI) systems are being used more and more in our everyday lives to help us in decision-making.
When a human makes a decision you can ask them how they came to their decisions or predictions. But with many AI algorithms, a prediction is provided without any particular reason, and you can not ask that machine to explain how it came to that decision.
It can be dangerous to rely on a black box. How can you trust a model without transparency? We need accountability and explanation to trust these systems. The more AI is part of our lives the more we need these black boxes to be transparent.
The solution is to come up with AI systems that explain their decision-making â€” what is known as eXplainable AI or XAI.
