Dice and Jaccard’s explained…


We are working on a deep learning model that predicts masks for brain tumors or skin lesions. What is making a mask? We classify pixels of an image as 1 or 0. If there is a mask in a pixel we state 1, if there is not a mask we state 0. Making pixelwise binary classification of images is called “Semantic Segmentation”.
